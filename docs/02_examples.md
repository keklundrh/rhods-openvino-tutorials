Simply select "openvino_notebooks" from the file explorer on the left. 

There are 25-30 examples to choose from! 
For now, let's focus on the following three examples: 
* Person Detection 
* Speech to Text 
* Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

Follow the instructions below to run each OpenVINO example with Red Hat OpenShift Data Science.
Additionally, we provide links (below) to Intel's detailed documentation for example example. 

## Examples 

### Person Detection 

![openvino-111](./assets/img/examples/openvino-111.png)

Select the "111-detection-quantization" folder after "openvino_notebooks" and open the "111-detection-quantization.ipynb" notebook. 
The tutorial will prepare your environment, download the model, quantize it, and compare the model to the quantized version.

### Speech to Text 

![openvino-211](./assets/img/examples/openvino-211.png)

Select the "211-speech-to-text" folder after "openvino_notebooks" and open the "211-speech-to-text.ipynb" notebook. 
The tutorial will prepare your environment, download the model, quantize it, and compare the model to the quantized version.
